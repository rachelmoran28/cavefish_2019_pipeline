5/23/19. Re-started pipeline from raw reads for Caballo Moro, Jineo, Escondido, and new samples from Josh Gross and UMGC ("June2019" samples).

Used Adamâ€™s pipeline and Adam's alignments for all other individuals (https://github.umn.edu/aherman/cavefish_RIS).

Step 1: Adapter removal and quality trimming 


All raw reads were processed with cutadapt-1.2.1 and trimmomatic-0.30.

Samples from BGI (Jineo, Escondido, and all other samples from JG) had unknown barcodes (kept private by BGI), so they were processed with cutadapt using the following Illumina TruSeq adapters and NNNs in place of the individual barcode on R1 (need to suple wildcard flag to cutadapt for this to work):
R1: GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCACNNNNNNATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG
R2: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT

Caballo Moro samples had the same adapters as BGI samples, but barcodes on R1 were known for each individual and supplied to cutadapt. Cutadapt version 1.2.1 and the newest version (2.3.0) both had issues processing these samples (kept resulting in corrupt fastqs with extra lines), so trimmomatic-0.30 was used to do the adapter clipping and quality trimming for these samples.

After processing with cutadapt and/or trimmomatic, reads were ready to align.

Step 2: Alignment to surface and cave genomes


Processed reads for each sample were aligned to both the cavefish (v1) and the surface fish (v2) genomes.
